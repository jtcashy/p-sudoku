# p-sudoku

This project takes in a sudoku puzzle and then solves it using a backtracking algorithm.
Files are read in using command line redirection (./puzzle_driver < game-1.txt). 

Formated sudoku puzzles can be found within the 'test puzzles' folder. 

In the future, I plan to increase functionality by having the program generate unique sudoku puzzles.
Additionally, I will further streamline the backtracking algorithm and increase the number of test puzzles.
